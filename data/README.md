## How did we collect data for the research?

We used the CoppeliaSim simulator to simulate robots doing inspection tasks, and collecting [Odometry/Pose](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html) data.

All robot trajectory planning and ROS integration are available at [ITV/ROC](https://github.com/ITVRoC/espeleo_vrep_simulation) repositories.

(add an image for a robot at the simulator).

## Robot Trajectories

The robots' trajectories for the data collected are the following:
